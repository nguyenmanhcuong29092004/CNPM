# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our QAGPT repository is important to us. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in the QAGPT, please report it to us so we can work together to fix it promptly. 

### How to Report a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please follow the steps below:

1. **Contact**: Send an email to **[nhuy1396@gmail.com]**. This contact is monitored regularly by our security team.
2. **What to include**:
   - Detailed information about the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if applicable.
   - Impact of the vulnerability, including how it might be exploited.
   - Any other context or screenshots that might be helpful in understanding the issue.
3. **Confidentiality**: Keep the issue confidential until we have assessed and resolved it. This helps in preventing the exploitation of the community and users.

### Response and Resolution

- **Acknowledgment**: We aim to respond to your report within 48 hours to acknowledge receipt.
- **Collaboration**: We may contact you for further information and will keep you updated on the status of the vulnerability.
- **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability is assessed, we will release a fix and publicly release an advisory detailing the issue and its resolution.

## Public Acknowledgments

We believe in recognizing the efforts of those who make our software safer. Individuals who report a vulnerability will be acknowledged for their contribution (unless they prefer to remain anonymous). Such acknowledgments will be posted in our projectâ€™s release notes.

Thank you for helping keep the QAGPT and its users safe!
